## :package: How to Install (Normal Installation)

Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/GameGodS3/DropPoint/releases) to download the latest releases

- Windows
  - Download `DropPoint-1.x.x-win.zip` from Releases and extract to a blank folder. Run `DropPoint.exe`.
  - To enable stickyness across Virtual Desktops (Windows) go to Task view while DropPoint is running, right click it and tick **"Show Window from this app on all Desktops"**. Stickyness in other Operating Systems works by default.
- Mac
  - Download `DropPoint-1.x.x-intel.dmg` or `DropPoint-1.x.x-arm64-Apple-Silicon.dmg`(for Apple M1 Devices only) from Releases and install. Open "System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Open Anyway"
- Linux
  - All Linux Distros: Download `DropPoint-1.x.x.AppImage` to run.
  - Debian-based Distros (Ubuntu, Mint, PopOs, etc): Download `droppoint_1.x.x_amd64.deb`.
  - Arch-based Distros (Manjaro, Arch, etc.): Download `droppoint-1.x.x.tar.gz`
  - RHEL-based Distros (Fedora, Red Hat, etc): Download `droppoint-1.x.x.x86_64.rpm`.

## :v: Usage

- Drag and drop any file(s) or folder from the system into DropPoint, go to your desired location and drag it out.
- App minimises to tray by default when you close the instance. To open instance, click on system tray. To quit, right click on tray icon > Quit.
- While DropPoint is in the system tray, pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> anywhere in your PC would create a new instance of DropPoint, at mouse location. (as tested on Windows and Linux) (the shortcut is <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> on MacOs)
