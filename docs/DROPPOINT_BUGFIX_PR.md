### Requirements for Contributing a Bug Fix

* Fill out the template below. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.
* Include `[Bug Fix]` in the Pull Request title.
* The pull request must only fix an existing bug. To contribute other changes, you must use a different template. You can see all templates at <https://github.com/GameGodS3/DropPoint/tree/main/docs>.
* After you create the pull request, all status checks must be pass before a maintainer reviews your contribution.

### Identify the Bug

<!--

Link to the issue describing the bug that you're fixing.

If there is not yet an issue for your bug, please open a new issue and then link to that issue in your pull request.
Note: In some cases, one person's "bug" is another person's "feature." If the pull request does not address an existing issue with the "bug" label, the maintainers have the final say on whether the current behavior is a bug.
